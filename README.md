<div>hmpl is a small template language for displaying UI from server to client. It is based on <em>customizable</em> requests sent to the server via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">fetch</a> and processed into ready-made HTML. Reduce the size of your javascript files and display the same UI as if it was written in a modern framework.</div>

## Usage

```javascript
import hmpl from "hmpl-js";

document.querySelector("#app").append(
  hmpl.compile(
    `<div>
        <button data-action="increment" id="btn">Click!</button>
        <div>Clicks: { { "src": "/api/clicks", "after": "click:#btn" } }</div>
    </div>`
  )(({ request: { event } }) => ({
    body: event.target.getAttribute("data-action")
  })).response
);
```

## Features

- **Customizable**: Send a custom request to the server when receiving the UI
- **Based on Fetch API**: Use a modern standard instead of `XMLHTTPRequest`
- **Server-oriented**: Work with the server directly through markup and with a little js
- **Memory Preserving**: Reduce file sizes on the client by several times
- **Simple**: Get ready-made UI from the server by writing a couple of lines of familiar object syntax
- **Flexible**: Can be used in almost any project due to not only working through a script, but also working in files with the `.hmpl` extension
- **No dependencies**: Can connect from one js file
- **Small bundle size**: Lots of functionality in a couple of kilobytes
